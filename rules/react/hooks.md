# React Hooks

> This file covers **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, custom hooks) — NOT the Claude Code `hooks/` runtime system. Naming matches the per-language convention `rules/<lang>/hooks.md` used across this repo.

## Rules of Hooks

1. Hooks only at the top level of a function component or another hook
2. Never in loops, conditionals, nested functions, or after early returns
3. Always called in the same order on every render
4. Only inside React function components or custom hooks (functions starting with `use`)

```tsx
// WRONG: conditional hook
function Foo({ enabled }: { enabled: boolean }) {
  if (enabled) {
    const [x, setX] = useState(0); // rule violation
  }
}

// CORRECT: hook unconditional, condition inside
function Foo({ enabled }: { enabled: boolean }) {
  const [x, setX] = useState(0);
  if (!enabled) return null;
  return <span>{x}</span>;
}
```

## `useEffect` — When NOT to Use

`useEffect` is for synchronizing with external systems (subscriptions, browser APIs, third-party libraries). It is **not** the right tool for:

- Derived state — compute it during render
- Transforming data for rendering — compute it during render
- Resetting state when a prop changes — use a `key` on the parent or derive from props
- Notifying parents of state changes — call the callback in the event handler
- Initializing app-level singletons — call the function module-side or in `main.tsx`

```tsx
// WRONG: effect for derived state
const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
useEffect(() => {
  setFullName(`${first} ${last}`);
}, [first, last]);

// CORRECT: derive during render
const fullName = `${first} ${last}`;
```

## Dependency Arrays

- Always include every reactive value referenced inside the effect/callback
- Enable `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` lint rule — never silence it without a comment explaining why
- If the dep array grows unwieldy, the effect is doing too much — split it
- Stable identity for functions passed in deps: wrap in `useCallback` only when the function is itself a dependency of another hook or passed to a memoized child

## Cleanup

Every subscription, interval, listener, or in-flight request must clean up.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal }).then(handleResponse);
  return () => controller.abort();
}, [url]);
```

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(tick, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(id);
}, []);
```

Missing cleanup = race conditions when deps change, memory leaks on unmount.

## `useMemo` and `useCallback` — When Worth It

Default position: **do not memoize**. Add `useMemo` / `useCallback` only when:

1. The value is passed to a `React.memo`-wrapped child as a prop, and identity matters
2. The value is a dependency of another `useEffect` / `useMemo` / `useCallback`
3. The computation is measurably expensive (profile before assuming)

Premature memoization adds noise, hides bugs, and can be slower than the recompute it replaces.

## Custom Hooks

Components should remain focused on rendering UI. Any state management with meaningful logic should generally live in a custom hook.

Extract a custom hook when:

- State management involves more than simple `useState` setters
- Multiple hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, etc.) work together to implement a piece of behavior
- The logic may grow over time or benefit from isolated testing
- The behavior could reasonably be reused in the future, even if it currently has a single consumer

Inline state only when:

- It is extremely simple (e.g. a single `useState` with trivial updates)
- Moving it into a hook would only add indirection without improving readability

**Prefer extracting early rather than waiting for a second consumer.** Components are easier to read when stateful behavior is encapsulated behind a descriptive hook.

```tsx
export function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
  const [debounced, setDebounced] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setTimeout(() => setDebounced(value), delay);
    return () => clearTimeout(id);
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debounced;
}
```

## `useState` Patterns

- Initial state from prop only at mount: pass a function `useState(() => computeInitial(prop))` when computation is expensive
- Functional updater when the new state depends on the old: `setCount(c => c + 1)` — never `setCount(count + 1)` inside async or batched contexts
- Group related state into one object only when they always change together; otherwise split into multiple `useState` calls
- Use `useReducer` once state transitions are conditional on the previous state or there are 3+ related values

## `useRef` Patterns

- DOM refs for imperative APIs (focus, scroll, third-party libs)
- Mutable container that does not trigger re-render (timer ids, previous values, "is mounted" flags)
- Never read or write `ref.current` during render — only inside effects or event handlers
- `useImperativeHandle` only when exposing a child API to a parent ref — last-resort escape hatch

## `useSyncExternalStore`

Use this hook to subscribe to any external store (browser API, third-party state lib, custom event emitter). It is the supported way to make external state safe with concurrent rendering.

```tsx
const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(
  (cb) => {
    window.addEventListener('online', cb);
    window.addEventListener('offline', cb);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', cb);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', cb);
    };
  },
  () => navigator.onLine,
  () => true
);
```

## Stale Closure Trap

Async handlers and intervals capture the values from the render where they were created. Fix by:

1. Using the functional updater form of `setState`
2. Putting the changing value in the dep array of `useEffect` and rebuilding the handler
3. Reading from a ref that is kept in sync
